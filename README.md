### Howdy 🤠

I am Joseph Grable, but you can call me Joey. I specialize in connecting content and marketing teams with the data they need, providing valuable insights into the impact of their digital advertising campaigns.

🔭 Currently, I am immersed in developing marketing automation systems and refining data analytics processes for marketing teams in the home building and real estate industries.

🌱 I am actively learning Python programming and TypeScript to craft scalable, full-stack applications.

🤔 I am seeking guidance on scaling applications for enterprises and effectively managing small teams of designers and developers.

💬 Feel free to ask me about calligraphy, type design, or bookmaking! My journey began in graphic arts and evolved into a computer programmer; I thrive at the intersection of design and technology.

💩 Fun fact: I am living with Crohn’s disease and have a penchant for occasional toilet humor.

👯 Jazz Hands 👐
